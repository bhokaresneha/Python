19. Accept the electric unit from user and calculate the bill according to following rates.
First 100 Units : Free
Next 200 Units : Rs 2 per day.
Above 300 Units : Rs 5 per day.
If number of unit is 500 then total bill = 0 + 400 + 1000 = 1400

=>

unit=int(input("Enter the electric units=>"))

if unit<=100:
    print(unit*0)
elif unit>100 and unit<300:
    unit1=(unit-100)*2
    print(unit1)
elif unit>300:
    unit1=(100*0)+(200*2)+(unit-300)*5
    print(unit1)

#OUTPUT=>
Enter the electric units => 500
1400

[note-  0----------100--------300------
            0rs          2rs       5rs
basically first 100 unit 0 cost then next 200 units means 100+200=300
so its rage is 300 then for calculation (100*0)for first 100(200*2)next 200
(unit-300)from 300 we subtract units bcz 5rs range start after 300 units
 number of unit is 500 then total bill = 0 + 400 + 1000 = 1400]
